### Rewards

For the majority of the bounties, the only reward should be the bounty prize set in accordance with the [bounty processes](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/blob/master/.processes/bounty.md). When a bounty hunter goes beyond the bounty’s scope, it’s often good to reward that with a tip, either in the form of more payment or NFT, this should encourage a return-back.
The higher rank, the more eligible they are to receive more rewards.
